#Design Approach

- First idea is using slider to show all availble skips, but this is somehow NOT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT as required.
- Second idea is to show only one skip depending on user selection, but what if a user wants to compare between available skip options?
- The FINAL design decition is to combine both ideas: 
  1. The user select the prefered skip size.
  2. The selected skip is displayed with a comparison table with its closest skips.
